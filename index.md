# Description

Introduction to the [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
programming language, with a focus on practical tools and techniques for scientific data
analysis. Previous programming experience in a language such as
[Matlab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) or
[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is an asset, but not required.
Introduces various key Python libraries, and provides example problems. Students will be
encouraged to bring their own specific data analysis problems to class, for immediate
applicability to their work, culminating in a course project. Basic command line operations
and code version control with Git will also be covered. Students are expected to bring their
own laptop. A minimal level of attendance and participation is required in both the lecture
and the exercise class, but no homework will be assigned.

This course corresponds to lectures no. 19291 and 19292 in the official [course
