# Description

Introduction to the Python programming language, with a focus on practical tools and
techniques for scientific data analysis. Previous programming experience in a language such as
Matlab or R is an asset, but not required. Introduces various key Python libraries, and
provides example problems. Students will be encouraged to bring their own specific data
analysis problems to class, for immediate applicability to their work, culminating in a course
project. Basic command line operations and code version control with Git will also be covered.
Students are expected to bring their own laptop. A minimal level of attendance and
participation in both is required, but no homework will be assigned.

This course corresponds to lectures no. 19291 and 19292 in the official [course
