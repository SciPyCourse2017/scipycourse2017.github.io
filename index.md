**Tuesdays, April 25 to July 25, 2017**<br>
**LMU Biozentrum, Room D00.013**<br>
**Lecture: 13-14:30; Exercise class: 14:30-16**

Taught by [Martin Spacek](http://mspacek.github.io) (lecture) and [Nick Del
Grosso](https://github.com/neuroneuro15) (exercise class)

# Description

Introduction to the [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
programming language, with a focus on practical tools and techniques for scientific data
analysis. Previous programming experience in a language such as
[Matlab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) or
[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is an asset, but not required.
Introduces various key Python libraries, and provides example problems. Students will be
encouraged to bring their own specific data analysis problems to class, for immediate
applicability to their work, culminating in a course project. Basic command line operations
and code version control with Git will also be covered. Students are expected to bring their
own laptop. A minimal level of attendance and participation is required in both the lecture
and the exercise class, but no homework will be assigned.

This course corresponds to lectures no. 19291 and 19292 in the official [course
listing](https://lsf.verwaltung.uni-muenchen.de/qisserver/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&publishid=636766&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfo&publishSubDir=veranstaltung).

# Tutorials

These are all free, and require no signup or login:

### Basic Python

* <http://introtopython.org> - is excellent!

* <http://learnpython.org> - has online editable and executable code

* <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html> - also has online
  editable and executable code, plus quizzes and videos

### IPython and Jupyter

* [IPython](http://ipython.org) is an improved Python interactive terminal. This is
  what we will mostly spend our time in:
  <http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html>

* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) is IPython running in a web browser. It allows you to create
  "notebooks" that combine code, formatted text, and results:
  <http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/examples_index.html>

### Specific libraries

* Numpy is probably the most important data analysis library for Python:
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html>

* SciPy is another important library:
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial>

* Matplotlib is the most popular plotting library:
  <http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html>

* Pandas is another useful Python library for data analysis, built on top of numpy, that we'll
  introduce in the course. It has several tutorials:
  <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html>
